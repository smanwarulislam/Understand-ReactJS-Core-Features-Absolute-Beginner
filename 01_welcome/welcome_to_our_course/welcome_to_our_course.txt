Start Your Frontend Development Journey

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a UI library used to create interactive user interfaces.
For frontend development using React (also known as React.js or ReactJS), you will need numerous other tools.
Most tutorials don't focus on React's (also known as React.js or ReactJS) fundamental concepts while teaching complete front-end development.
As a result of which problems are faced later.
In this Chunk i.e. in the course we have only emphasized the fundamentals of React (also known as React.js or ReactJS).
So that you have a good idea about React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) and you can think like React (also known as React.js or ReactJS).

This course is going to be a great resource for you!
But before starting this course you need to ensure a few things (Prerequisites).

Prerequisites before start:

· Must have a good knowledge of JavaScript. Must have working experience with JavaScript basics and ES6 (ECMAScript 6).
· A little knowledge of ES5 but a good working knowledge of ES6 (ECMAScript 6) is required. ES6 (ECMAScript 6) is actually modern JavaScript.
· Must have a minimum understanding of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Because you need to know how to design websites before learning frontend frameworks.
· Since you will be doing front-end development, you should have minimal knowledge of DOM Manipulation.

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS)
In the end, I will say one thing, React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is all about JavaScript.

· React (software) - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(software)

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.
React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.
Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM,
React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.
