4. How Does ReactJS Work

How Does React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) Work?

At First Recap Our Previous Knowledge (diagram_1.png):

How Do We Design Traditional Website?
· HTML
· CSS
· JavaScript

ReactJS Works Totally Differently

Everything in ReactJS is A Component

The Component is A Small Piece of UI (diagram_2.png):

✔ We can reuse it
✔ We can use it with other components
✔ We can pass data to it from outside
✔ It can have its own data
✔ It can be styled separately
✔ It can be used as many times as we want

Component Composition (diagram_3.png)
· Main Component
· Component A
· Component B
· Component C

What's Inside The Component? (diagram_4.png):

Component has Two Main Layer -
✔ Data Layer
✔ Representation Layer

· Component

Data Layer:
All Logic Goes Here, Our Task is Anyhow Change The Data

Representation Layer:
This is Just Static HTML, When Data Change, It will Update Automatically

In React, Our Responsibility is to Create A Static View For Small Pieces of UI and Change The Data Anyhow.
Rest of The Thing React will Do For Us.

How can We Use Multiple Components? (diagram_5.png)

It's Easy, The Representation Layer of A Component can Render Other Components
